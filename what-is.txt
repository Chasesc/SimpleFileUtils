SimpleFileUtils currently has two main functions:

1.)  removing duplicate files in a directory
	
	Example: Sample directory includes a.mp3, a (Copy).mp3, a(1).mp3, a.txt
			 a (Copy).mp3 and a(1).mp3 would be removed.

	Command line syntax:
	SimpleFileUtils -d "path_to_directory"


2.) removing old files in a directory

	This removes files older than the amount of days you specify.

	Command line syntax:
	SimpleFileUtils -o (-a OR -w) h "path_to_directory"

	where:
	-a = file ages are defined by the last time you accessed them (Currently unsupported)
	-w = file ages are defined by the last time you wrote to them.
	h  = the amount of integer hours.  Anything greater than this amount is defined as an old file. 


NOTE: The default setting asks you to confirm before deleting the files.
      If you wish to have no confirmation, simply append "-f" to the arguments.
